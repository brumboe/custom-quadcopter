# Custom Quadcopter Project

This repository documents the design, simulation, and control of a custom
quadcopter, developed from first principles.

The project covers:
- Mechanical design (FreeCAD)
- Dynamic modeling and simulation (Gazebo / ROS2)
- Flight control (custom controllers)
- Logging, tuning, and validation

This is a learning-focused, engineering-first project.
Mistakes, redesigns, and failures are documented intentionally.

# Project Status
